                </a>
                <p>Our firm recently secured a $5 million verdict for a client who suffered permanent injuries due to
                    surgical negligence. The jury found the hospital liable for failing to follow proper protocols
                    during the procedure.
                    Impact: This victory not only compensates the client for their pain and suffering but also
                    highlights the importance of holding medical professionals accountable.
